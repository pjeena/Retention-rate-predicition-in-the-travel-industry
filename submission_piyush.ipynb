    "This is fictitious data from a possible company in the travel industry. Most customers only travel with the provider once in a lifetime. However, some customers are returning, these are called repeaters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to optimize the marketing, the customer would like to implement an NBO (Next-Best-Offer) system that predicts which of the previous customers have a high probability of returning in the next year. The goal is to exclude customers with a very low probability of repeating from marketing campaigns and thus reduce costs. E.g. for printed advertisements and catalogues.\n",

    "• As an extension, the company is not only interested in whether, but also where (destination in the booking data) the repeaters will travel to. If you have an approach on how you would identify this “next best destination”, just add this briefly to the text concept. Really just the idea in a few words. PS: this extension gives the case its name as an NBO system.\n",
    "\n",
    "• As a further enhancement, the company would like to know when the customers would purchase the travel in order to send the customer an additional incentive at the right moment. Here, too, please only briefly one or more approaches in text form.\n",
